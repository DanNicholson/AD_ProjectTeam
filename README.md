# AD_ProjectTeam

This the new team repository.

---05 November 2017---
Unfortunately Chris, whom was part of our team has left the course, and Sarah has gone MIA and we can probably assume that she has also left the course. This has left Arjun and myself to carry on the project. (Dan~)

I've added some stuff to the mood board! Most of the stuff there is from Star Wars, Star Fox and some classic shoot 'em ups like Galaga and Gradius but they're at least what was thinking of.
