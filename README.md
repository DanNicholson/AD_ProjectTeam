# AD_ProjectTeam

This the new team repository.

Unfortunately Chris, whom was part of our team has left the course, and Sarah has gone MIA and we can probably assume that she has also left the course. This has left Arjun and myself to carry on the project. (Dan~)

I've added some stuff to the mood board! Most of the stuff there is from Star Wars, Star Fox and some classic shoot 'em ups like Galaga and Gradius but they're at least what was thinking of.

I've added a movement system which uses the arrow keys on the keyboard. I've set it so it works on game time. This way if there are any weird frame drops then the player won't be teleporting around.
I've also begun prototyping the shooting system. It is activated with the space bar. It still needs tweaking though. It doesn't do auto fire at a decent rate, but it's getting there!
